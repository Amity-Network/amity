## Compiling NERVA from source

Nerva comes bundled with some build scripts to make building from source a very simple proposition.  

Simply run `./builder/<platform> build-release`

For example `./builder/linux build-release`

Platforms exist of linux, mac and windows. linux and mac will work straight out of the box. Windows requires setting up a MinGW build environment
